SELECT title, year, worldwide FROM topmovies WHERE studio = "Sony" GROUP BY year;

#5. What movies were released after 2000 that also had a worldwide gross of over $700 million?
SELECT title, worldwide, studio FROM topmovies WHERE year > 2000 AND worldwide > 700 GROUP BY year;

#6. What movie studios had an average domestic gross of over $300 million?
SELECT studio, AVG(domestic) as avg_domestic FROM topmovies GROUP BY studio HAVING avg_domestic > 300;

#7. Which of the top 100 movies had a domestic gross of the target $600 million? Where they above or below target?
SELECT title, domestic, 
    CASE
        WHEN domestic > 600 THEN "above target"
        WHEN domestic < 600 THEN "below target"
    END as "target expectations"
FROM topmovies;
